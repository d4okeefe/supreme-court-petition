    <p>
        Your petition probably does not have a docket number yet. If you filed an earlier application or motion in this
        case, the Clerk’s Office will assign a new docket number to the petition. If this is a <a
            href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/ctrules/2019RulesoftheCourt.pdf#page=44&zoom=150,0,580"
            target=_blank>Rule 12.5</a> conditional
        cross petition, the Clerk’s Office will assign a new docket number, linked to the underlying petition’s docket.
        You SHOULD ONLY INCLUDE A DOCKET NUMBER if you have already filed an IFP petition in this case (<a
            href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/ctrules/2019RulesoftheCourt.pdf#page=12&zoom=150,0,280"

            target=_blank>Rule 33.2</a>), but the Court denied your indigency application and gave you
        time to refile in booklet format; in that instance, you should type in the docket number that the Clerk’s Office
        assigned to the original IFP petition.

        Docket Number Tip
    </span>
    <p>
        If you use a docket number style that pre-prints the term-year prefix (like "20-"), note that the Court’s
        docketing cycle runs from the beginning of July through the end of June. So for example, petitions docketed
        between July 2020 and June 2021 will all receive docket numbers starting "20-," even those filed in the calendar
        year 2021.

        Do not include a line like, "October Term 2020." You may have seen that style on older petition examples, but
        the Court no longer wants this text on the cover.

        Do not automatically use the same caption that appeared on documents in the courts below. A Supreme Court

        Your petition will initiate the petition-stage of this case, so the proceedings line should begin, "On Petition
        for..." You are likely seeking a writ of certiorari (although <a

            target=_blank>Rule 20</a> describes other writ types), so the next
        clause should read, "...a Writ of Certiorari…" And the final clause should identify the last court that
        considered the merits of your case, saying, "...to the [full name of the last merits court]."

    <p>
        The last merits court may not be the last court to issue an order. This issue often arises when a state’s
        highest court declined to take discretionary review. If a lower court’s order essentially says, "We decided not
        to look at this…" it is likely not a merits order; but if it says, "We looked at this and decided... " then it
        is a merits order. You should make a fair attempt to identify the proper merits court, but understand that an
        incorrect identification will not disqualify your petition.
